# M365EnterpriseDemoCustomizer

 The Script Customize-M365EnterpriseDemo.ps1 is intended to be used with M365 Enterprise Demo tenants
 The whole idea behind it is to assign different Azure AD Built-in roles to different users
 This is useful to test different scenarios where it would be better not to use a can-do-all user like Global Administrator
 Some users have more than one role as I would like all Administrative users to also have the licenses provided by the Demo tenant.
 Contributions are very well welcomed and I need feedback!
